# oxid-whoops

Integration of the [whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops/) error handler base/framework for PHP into the [OXID](http://www.oxid-esales.com) eShop.

-----

**whoops** is an error handler base/framework for PHP. Out-of-the-box, it provides a pretty
error interface that helps you debug your web projects, but at heart it's a simple yet
powerful stacked error handling system.

## Authors

This whoops library was primarily developed by [Filipe Dobreira](https://github.com/filp), and is was originaly created by [Denis Sokolov](https://github.com/denis-sokolov). A lot of awesome fixes and enhancements were also sent in by [various contributors](https://github.com/filp/whoops/contributors).
The smx_whoops module for integrating whoops into OXID was developed by shoptimax GmbH, Gernot Payer and [Stefan Moises](https://github.com/smxsm). 

This is modified version of the module with some improvements made by [Justinas Bolys](https://github.com/sanis).
